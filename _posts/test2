description: Moe Rubenzahl presented this powerful on article on commitments at the January 2017 General Meeting. This is a timeless article that we should return to often. I encourage men to make commitments to your team, at GMs, and in the growth category of Discourse. This is a key way to Own Momentum in our lives.

## Add More Real Content
Kim, I had told you to add place holder text for some of the articles, particularly the ones that were too inside, like my fear process.  I think it would be good to have some real content that is taken from our current website.

1. **Info about the Monthly Meeting** [Current text is here](https://www.gomomentum.org/monthly-meeting)
3. **Standards** [Current text is here](https://www.gomomentum.org/mission)
4. **About Us**:  [Current text is here](https://www.gomomentum.org/about_us)
5. **FAQ** I think we can convert much of [this](https://www.gomomentum.org/about_us) page to an FAQ
